# Alertmanager Email Demo (with MailHog)

This project shows how to use **Prometheus + Alertmanager** to send alert notifications as emails.  
It uses [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), a lightweight SMTP server with a web UI that captures all outgoing mail.

## ðŸš€ Run the Stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abadibusra/alertmanager-email-demo.git
cd alertmanager-email-demo
docker-compose up -d
```

Services:

Prometheus â†’ http://localhost:9090
Alertmanager â†’ http://localhost:9093

Defined in rules.yml

High CPU Load (CPU > 80% for 2m)

Out of Disk Space (disk < 10% free)

OOM Kill Detected

You can test it the way you want. For CPU stressing I used:
```
while true; do :; sleep 0; done
```
Alerts will appear in MailHog as FIRING and later RESOLVED emails.
